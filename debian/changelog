libneo4j-client (2.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release 2.1.2
    - Table output is much prettier, with cleaner boarders and _color_!
    - Values in table output are now wrapped (in neo4j-client, this can
      be disabled by unsetting the wrap option, e.g. `:set nowrap`).
    - Column widths in table output are now calculated based on
      inspecting the first 100 rows of the result (this can be adjusted
      or disabled using the inspect option, e.g. `:set inspect=0`).
    - Render the timing information returned by the server.
    - Update the profile/plan output, based on data returned from newer
      Neo4j versions.
    - Fixed an issue that would prevent prompting for updated passwords
      when reattempting auth.
  * New upstream release 2.0.0
    - Removed neo4j_session_t in favour of working only with connections
    - Replaced authentication callback mechanisms
    - Support rendering of multibyte characters in table output
